Simple chessboard implementation in React using the [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) notation.
Bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Chess rules aren't implemented but you can move pieces around using the mouse or edit the FEN code directly.
